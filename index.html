            <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
            <p>Hi, I'm Anurag Sharma, a Software Developer and Software Architect.</p>
            <p>Hello ðŸ‘‹ and welcome to my LinkedIn profile!<p>
            <p> As a student pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Psychology, I bring a unique set of skills and perspectives to the table. With a strong foundation in programming languages such as Java and Python, I am able to apply technical solutions to complex problems. Additionally, my background in psychology allows me to understand the human element of these problems, and to approach solutions from a holistic perspective.
                My passion for computer science stems from a desire to build innovative and impactful software that can make a difference in people's lives. Whether it's developing web applications or creating machine learning models, I am constantly seeking out new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow.
            </p>
            <p>At the same time, my interest in psychology has fueled a desire to understand human behavior and the factors that shape it. I am particularly interested in the intersection of technology and mental health, and how we can leverage technology to support and improve mental wellness.
                
           <p>Ultimately, I believe that the intersection of computer science and psychology holds tremendous potential for creating solutions that can positively impact individuals and communities. I am excited to continue exploring this intersection and to collaborate with others who share my passion for innovation and social impact.
        </p> 
            Thank you for visiting my profile, and I look forward to connecting with you!ðŸ˜Š</p>
